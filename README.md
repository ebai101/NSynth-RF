# NSynth-RF

Exploring the [NSynth](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth) dataset with random forests in scikit-learn. Based on Nadim Kawwa's work found [here.](https://github.com/NadimKawwa/NSynth)

I removed the requirements.txt because I was running some very old libraries. I believe the only required externals are numpy, pandas, librosa, scipy and sklearn for the main code, and matplotlib for the plots.
